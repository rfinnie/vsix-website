Hi there, command line user!

This site is intended to be used by humans.
To discourage automated scraping, please go to the following URL,
which will change periodically:

    https://{{ server_hostname }}/?a={{ access_key }}

IPv6-only URL:
    https://six.{{ base_domain }}/?a={{ access_key }}
IPv4-only URL:
    https://four.{{ base_domain }}/?a={{ access_key }}
Random nocache URL:
    https://{{ randid }}.nocache.{{ base_domain }}/?a={{ access_key }}

Yes, you could trivially write something to automate this,
but please don't.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
